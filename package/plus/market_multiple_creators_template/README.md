# How to use market multiple creators template

1. Init the contract with a list of co-founders: address & share. The transaction creator account must be included in the list

2. Mint nfts: Mint 721 & 1155. Same input as market implementation, only add contract address

3. Sell & ask nft: TODO: need to adjust somehow to let the contract approves the co founders to sell, ask, ...

4. Receieve revenue: money will be sent to the contract => anyone can invoke the share revenue to distribute revenue to the co-founders.
