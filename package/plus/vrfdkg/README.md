## phrases:

- a number of members act as dealers send commit and secret_row encrypted by node[m] publick key and commit share
- all node[m] m in [0..total] will check the commit then aggreate secret_row shared to form the secret key share and commit publick key share
- each round will wait for all commits that are valid by checking with public key share, then combine the valid sig to produce randomness
